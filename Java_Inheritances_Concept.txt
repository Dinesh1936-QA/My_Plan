Java Inheritance Concepts:-

Here we used to call some function or methods from another classes 
The Main objective is Code reusability

1. Super Class [Parent Class]
2. Sub Class [Child Class]

syntax:
------------------------------------------------
class Subclass-name extends Superclass-name  
{  
   //methods and fields  
}  
------------------------------------------------

Using the "Extands" Keyword we can call once class from another class

Here mainly we focused on 3 types 

1. Single Inheritances      Class A <----- Class B

>>>>One Class inherits from another class

2. MultiLevel Inheritances          Class A <----- Class B <------ Class C

>>>>There is an chain of inheritance

3. Hierarchical Inheritances  
    |-->  Class A  <--|
    |                 |
 Class B           Class C    
 
 >>>>Two or more classes inherits from the Single class 

And also we have two types 

4. Multiple Inheritances -->>>> When one class inherits multiple classes, it is known as multiple inheritance. 

 Class A           Class B  
    ^               ^
    |--- Class C ---|
    
5. Hybrid Inheritances

   |-->  Class A  <--|
   |                 |
 Class B           Class C  
   ^                 ^
   |---- Class D ----|

Note : >>>>> But the Actuall Problem is : Multiple inheritance is not supported in Java through class.

The Reason is : >>>>> To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple inheritance is not supported in java.
